# App of Weather Forecast

The challenge was to create a web page that was responsive and that contained some characteristics such as displaying date/time, city, current temperature, weather description, minimum and maximum temperature, wind speed and humidity, all these characteristics were met with the template that I chose and which is in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/AeKiQhPvUPD7R8Xwb99F2w/Untitled?node-id=501%3A106).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

To install the dependencies.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
